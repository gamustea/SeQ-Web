"""
Received Path Anomaly rule.

Consumes the parsed Received chain (built by
``services.received_parser``) and emits a score reflecting how clean the
path looks. The rule deliberately **avoids double-counting** signals
that other rules already cover:

* Time inversions are already penalised by
  ``Received Chain Temporal Inconsistency``.
* A private/loopback origin IP is already penalised by
  ``Received Chain``.

This rule contributes only **new** signals:

* TLS downgrades between consecutive hops (encrypted hop followed by a
  clear hop).
* Excessively long chains (>= 5 hops with mostly unique IPs).
* Hops with unparseable timestamps when the rest of the chain has them.

A clean, short, fully-encrypted path earns a small positive bonus so
the rule can also *legitimise* a message.
