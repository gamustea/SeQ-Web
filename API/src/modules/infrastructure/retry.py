"""
Retry helper for transient database failures.

Wraps a callable that performs its own database work (typically opening a
``UnitOfWork``) and retries it when the failure is *transient* — a dropped
connection, a deadlock, or a serialization failure — rather than a genuine
logic or integrity error.

Only idempotent operations should be retried: re-running the callable must be
safe. In SeQ this is applied to the background DB phases of the scheduler
(load + record run timestamps), never to the request path where a handler may
have non-idempotent side effects.

Between attempts the thread-scoped session is removed (``close_all``) so the
next attempt starts from a clean session instead of inheriting an aborted
transaction — the same resilience guarantee the request teardown provides.

Functions:
    is_transient_error:  Classify a SQLAlchemy exception as transient or not.
    retry_on_transient:  Decorator that retries on transient errors with backoff.
