"""
Request-scoped session management for Flask.

Provides a session that lives for the duration of a single HTTP request,
eliminating the need for eager-loading workarounds. Within a request,
lazy loading of SQLAlchemy relationships works transparently because
the session is not closed until the response is sent.

Functions:
    get_db_session:             Return (or create) the request-scoped session.
    init_request_session:       Flask before_request hook that opens the session.
    shutdown_request_session:   Flask teardown_request hook that commits/rolls
                                back and closes the session.

Usage:
    Add the following to your Flask app factory::

        from src.modules.infrastructure.session import (
            init_request_session, shutdown_request_session
        )
        app.before_request(init_request_session)
        app.teardown_request(shutdown_request_session)

    In repositories or managers::

        from src.modules.infrastructure.session import get_db_session

        repo = ScanRepository(session=get_db_session())
        scan = repo.get_by_id(42)
        print(scan.host.hostname)  # lazy load works

def get_db_session():

    Return the database session for the current Flask request.

    Creates a new session on first call within a request and caches it
    in Flask's ``g`` object. Subsequent calls return the same session.
    Safe to call from any manager or repository during request processing.

    Returns:
        SQLAlchemy Session bound to the current request/thread.

    Flask ``teardown_request`` hook — finalize the DB session.

    - If an exception was raised during the request, performs a rollback.
    - Otherwise, attempts to commit the transaction.
    - Always closes the session and removes the scoped session from the
      registry, preventing session leaks.

    Note:
        A failed commit is rolled back and logged but **not** re-raised. This
        hook runs after the response has already been produced, so propagating
        here cannot change what the client receives; integrity is already
        protected by the rollback, and re-raising would only surface as an
        unhandled error in a post-response hook.

    Args:
        exception: The exception raised during the request, if any.
                   Supplied automatically by Flask.
