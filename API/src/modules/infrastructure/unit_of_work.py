"""
Unit of Work — transaction boundary over the ambient database session.

``UnitOfWork`` marks a transaction. It does **not** create, own, or close
sessions: the session lifecycle is managed at the two edges of the system —
``teardown_request`` for HTTP requests and the job boundary (``job_context``
for RQ workers, ``Scheduler.execute`` for the scheduler) for background work.
This keeps the request/background distinction in exactly two places instead of
scattered across every call site.

What ``__exit__`` does depends only on where it runs:

- **In a request**: no-op. The shared request session is committed/closed by
  ``teardown_request``, keeping the whole request in one atomic transaction
  and the session alive for lazy loading.
- **In a background context**: commits on clean exit, rolls back on error —
  the per-block transaction boundary that worker jobs rely on.
- **With an explicitly injected session** (tests): no-op; the caller owns the
  transaction.

This module also owns the engine/session-factory singletons used everywhere:
``initialize``, ``get_session``, ``warmup`` and ``close_all``.

Classes:
    UnitOfWork: Transaction boundary over the ambient session.

Usage:
    with UnitOfWork() as uow:
        ScanRepository(uow).save(scan)
        # In background: commits on clean exit. In a request: deferred to
        # teardown_request.
